## Introduction:
This quiz has been designed and created to challenge the knowledge of Marvel fans, when it comes to both the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) and comic books, whether they are a hardcore fan or even if they are just casual fans that want to test how muhc they really now.

The inspiration behind the quiz created, is from my love of Marvel; both the MCU and the comic books.

This document will include the development and testing processes taken in order to design and build this quiz along side the whole planning processes that have been taken.

This quiz is my second milestone project that is required for the completion of the full stack development course.

### Requirements:

For this project, the aim is to utilies the fundamentals of JavaScript along with elements of HTML and CSS in order to create an interactive quiz/ game that involves a selection of questions about both the MCU and Marvel comic book trivia to test how well the user/ player know this topic.


## UX:

## Target User Demographic:
The target demographic for this quiz are as follows:

* Marvel Comic Fans
* Comic Book Fans 
* Marvel Cinematic Universe Fans

### Goals for above target user demographic:
- To challenge their knowledge of quiz topic 
- To have fun/ be entertained
- Possibly learn new facts about quiz topic
- Navigate quiz with ease
- Simple but efective layout 


## Development Plan:

### Strategy:
Aim is to build a quiz using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that is simple, fun and interactive. Incorporating all, if not, most of the target user demographic goals that are stated above will be part of what the developer needs to take into account whilst creating and designing the qiuz. Whilst forming the strategy, the identity of the quiz should resemble and take inspiration from the quiz topic.

The quiz needs to provide the following:
- Light-hearted fun
- Entertainment
- Simple navigation


## Design:

### Structure:
The format/ structure to the quiz should follow the simple sturcture of a multiple choice quiz. The user/ player will answer a question that is shown by choosing from a selction of answers, one of which will be the correct answer. For every correct answer, a score out of 10 will be shown, therefore showing the user their progress through the quiz.

### Template:
For the template, Wireframes have been created to map out how the quiz/ game should look overall in its basic form. In order to keep the user engaged the overall look and interactivity of the quiz is kept in mind through the design process.

### Colour Palette:
For the colour palette, the inspiraion has mainly been taken from the Marvel logo itself with the bright solid red mainly along with the white that is also in the main logo. For the answer boxes, the decision made to use a lighter red was due to wanting the answers written to be clear for the user to read and les distracting to the eye.

### Typography:
The main font used throughout the quiz is Saira (Extra/ Semi Condensed), but also there is the back up of Sans-Serif, just in case any issues occcured with the primary font uploading. The font chosen was
